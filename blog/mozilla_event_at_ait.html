              <p class="center"><br>8th April 2017 marked the day when the first mozilla event was organised in Army Institute of Technology, organised by Abhijay Ghildiyal. Curious students with passion for open source showed up to gather knowledge about happennings in mozilla and how they can be a part of the mozilla community.
<br><br>
The event started with mozilla rep Prathamesh Chavan introducing us to Open source community. The history of Unix and Linux, that how Unix was protected by AT&T and developers, researchers with the licence were not allowed to change the source code, leading the development of Linux which was result of contribution of coders and lovers of open source. Also the freedom and ease which open source softwares gives to students and users of technology to learn new things or to make (pun intended) things.

Aniket Deshpandey then continued by making us aware about localisation of content. He simply began by asking meaning of localisation. Well localisation is adapting a new something to a place. In terms of Technology and Internet and sceniaro in India, all most all content such as Smart Phones, Operating Systems are in English which is a hurdle to cross for people who dont speak or understand English, also localising content in native languages will promote the technology itself and people will be able to connect to it and hence become a part of this evolving world. Aniket showed us his contribution in localisation of content after explaining its need. He has contributed to firefox by localising the firefox web browser into marathi language, fedora operating system.

Then we had a webinar on Rust by Vigneshwer Dhinakaran. After a few glitches in the video call, it was all set to start. Need a language which is flexible like c++ and secure and ensures memory safety say like python? voila! Rust is the answer. Rust is a systems programming language developed by mozilla, designed for better memory safety, prevents annoying segmentation faults, it has syntax similar to C++. Vigneshwar explained the basics of rust language, from declaring variables to methods, classes. He then briefed us about projects based on rust - <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo"> Servo </a> which is an experimental browser based on rust and <a href="https://github.com/dvigneshwer/deeprust">DeepRust</a> whose aim is to provide rusted libraries. His presentation can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q-BOnmkH85_1-ecr1j4fDMQcr4LBZflZ9vjPxwihBBw/edit#slide=id.g2058b61b7b_0_172">here</a>.

At last, Tushar Choudhary introduced us to <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/getting-started.html">Aframe</a> - a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. It makes developing virtual reality applications real easy by embedding the VR code directly into HTML code. Since it is a web application, it can be easily ported to various other platforms. Aframe has a big future ahead in various different fields like gaming, 3D modelling, it can also be used in e-commerece websites giving us a good overview of the products. It is also possible to create a virtual classroom which would make learning for students more fun and interesting. VirtualReality can be extended as far as you can imagine. Tushar along with Amit Singh explained their cool AFrame Project - <a href="https://bornfromashes.github.io/sastimasti/"> Sasti Masti </a>, <a href="https://github.com/Bornfromashes/sastimasti">source code</a>.</p>
